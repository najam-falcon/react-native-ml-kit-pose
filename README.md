# React Native App with ML Kit Pose Implementation

This is a React Native app that uses ML Kit Pose to detect and track human body pose in real-time.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/najam-falcon/react-native-ml-kit-pose
```

2. Install dependencies:
